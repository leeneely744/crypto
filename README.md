# Cryptographic Toolbox

This project aims to implement and understand various cryptographic tools and techniques. Below is the list of topics covered:

1. **One-Way Hash Functions**  
   Functions that map data to a fixed-size hash value, ensuring data integrity.

2. **Message Authentication Codes (MACs)**  
   Mechanisms to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message.

3. **Symmetric Cryptography**  
   Techniques for encrypting and decrypting data using the same key.

4. **Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs)**  
   Algorithms for generating sequences of numbers that approximate true randomness.

5. **Public-Key Cryptography**  
   Methods for secure communication using a pair of public and private keys.

6. **Digital Signatures**  
   Techniques for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents.

This repository will include implementations, tests, and examples for each of these cryptographic tools.
